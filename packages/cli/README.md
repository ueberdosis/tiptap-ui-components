# Tiptap CLI

The Tiptap CLI helps you scaffold [editors](https://tiptap.dev/docs/ui-components/templates/simple-editor), install [UI components](https://tiptap.dev/docs/ui-components/components/overview) or primitives, and configure Tiptap faster. It removes much of the manual work so you can start building editor features faster.

To use it, head over to the [documentation](https://tiptap.dev/docs/ui-components/getting-started/cli).
